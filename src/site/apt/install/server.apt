    * Just unpack the zip or tar.bz2 somewhere (e.g. /opt/apache-ant)

    * Add the "bin" directory to your PATH environment variable so you can invoke Ant from your command-line by typing "ant" (e.g. PATH=$PATH:/opt/apache-ant/bin)
 
  [[1]] Install the {{{http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads/}JBoss AS 4.2.3.GA}}
