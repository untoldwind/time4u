            <p>
                One of important features of the library is themes support. GWT widgets usually have specific styles
                which may be used style sheets. If the standard style name start from &quot;gwt-&quot;, Advanced GWT
                Components use another prefix: &quot;advanced-&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any widget of the library has a least one style. Currently therea are 3 themes included into the package:

                <ul>
                    <li>default</li>
                    <li>gray</li>
                    <li>ascetic</li>
                </ul>

                Visit the <a href="../demo/index.html">on-line demo</a> to know how they look. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Using themes you can dynamically switch look and feel. To do it use the <i>ThemeHelper</i> class.
                It's a singleton that stores current theme setting on client side. The sample below shows how you can
                do it.
            </p>
            <source>
ThemeHelper.getInstance().setThemeName("ascetic");
            </source>
            <p>
                To create your own theme you must place in the <i>public</i> folder the following structure of files:
            </p>
            <source>
- public
    - advanced
        - themes
            - your_theme_name
                - images
                  ...
                theme.css
            </source>
            <p>
                Place your theme images into the <i>images</i> folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                The easiest way to make a custom theme is to copy one of existent structures and change
                <i>theme.css</i>.
